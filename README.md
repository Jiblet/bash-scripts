# bash-scripts

A collection of Bash utilities for automating Raspberry Pi workflows and system tasks.  
No secrets are includedâ€”configuration happens via environment files.

## clone-pi.sh

Automates disk cloning on a Raspberry Pi using `rpi-clone`, with Discord webhook integration for notifications and UUID patching for boot config.

### Features
- Scans and matches USB disks by serial to abssolutely ensure the correct target- so you'll need to change that!
- Supports dry runs (`--dry-run`) for previewing target device
- Requires explicit `--force` to proceed with cloning
- Notifies via Discord webhook at all stages - see requirements
- Automatically patches `cmdline.txt` and `fstab` with new UUIDs

### Requirements
- `rpi-clone` installed
- `/home/jiblet/secrets.sh` file with:
  ```bash
  export CLONE_PI_DISCORD_WEBHOOK="your-webhook-url"

## Usage
./clone-pi.sh --dry-run    # scan and validate disk without cloning
./clone-pi.sh --force      # clone to target disk
